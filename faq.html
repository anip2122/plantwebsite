                  <summary>What types of plants are best suited for Kuching’s climate?</summary>
                  <p class="answer">In Kuching's tropical rainforest climate, plants that thrive are those that can handle both the year-round warm temperatures and the high humidity. Many of the plants you'll find in local nurseries and our shop are well-adapted to these conditions. This includes a variety of indoor plants such as Peace Lilies and Snake Plants, outdoor shrubs like Ixora and Hibiscus, as well as fruit-bearing trees, which are quite popular among local gardeners. These plants are known for their resilience and ability to thrive with the consistent rainfall and warm weather we experience here.</p>

                  <summary>How often should I water my plants in the humid Kuching weather?</summary>
                  <p class="answer">In Kuching's humid climate, plants generally require less frequent watering as the air moisture is often enough to keep them hydrated. Always check the topsoil—about 2 inches deep. If it feels dry, it’s time to water. Overwatering can be just as harmful as under-watering, so it's important to understand the needs of each plant species.</p>

                  <summary>Can you provide guidance on fertilizing tropical plants?</summary>
                  <p class="answer">Tropical plants in Kuching typically flourish with less frequent fertilization due to the naturally rich soils. However, a balanced fertilizer can be applied once every 2-3 months during the growing season. Slow-release fertilizers are great for consistent nutrient supply without the risk of over-fertilization.</p>
